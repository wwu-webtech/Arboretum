I’m going to give
                        a brief introduction to Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson.</p> <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, Ella Higginson was the most famous author from the Pacific
                        Northwest in the world. She had won multiple national awards, her books were extremely popular,
                        her poems were sung by major dramatic singers of the day, her work appeared in periodicals and
                        magazines and books in the United States and around the globe. Ella Higginson lived on Sehome
                        Hill and the house that she and her husband had built there was one of the first houses on
                        Sehome Hill. And this was before, what is now Western Washington University, had even been
                        thought of.</p> <p>The house that they built on Sehome Hill meant that Higginson was able to ride her horse daily
                        and take her dog with her all through the forests on Sehome Hill which had not been logged at
                        that point. Ella Higginson never went to church, instead though she was a very religious woman,
                        she said that she would go to Sehome Hill in the woods and walk around and there she would feel
                        closest to God.</p> <h3>How did Sehome Hill inspire Ella Higginson?</h3> <audio controls> <source src="higginsonaudio/how_did_sehome_hill_inspire_ella_higginson's_writing.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio> <h4>Transcript:</h4> <p>Laura Laffrado:</p> <p>This is Laura Laffrado. I’m a Professor at Western Washington University and I’m gonna talk about
                        how Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson, was so able to admire and be familiar with and
                        write about Sehome Hill. Ella Higginson’s house was built on Sehome Hill, where Viking Commons,
                        part of Western Washington University now stands.</p> <p>Her house was three stories high. It was 400 feet above sea level and so her windows, her Bay
                        windows, looked right out on Puget Sound. At the other side of her house, her windows looked
                        right out on Sehome Hill. And for the longest time there weren’t any other buildings or houses
                        there. And even when the building that is now known as Old Main is first constructed, it is the
                        sole building on campus for quite a few years. So Ella Higginson pretty much, no matter where
                        she was in her beautiful house, could look out over Puget Sound or could walk to the other end
                        of her house and look out at Sehome hill.</p> <p>The reason that Pacific Northwest author, Ella Higginson, is important when we think about the
                        history of Sehome Hill, is because, not only did she live on Sehome Hill, but she is the only
                        person who wrote about Sehome Hill in a very literary fashion in many of her poems and in many
                        of her prose works. So when Ella Higginson writes about Sehome Hill, we can see the various
                        stages that Sehome Hill goes through.</p> <p>She writes about the beauty of Sehome Hill before there are many homes on it. She writes about
                        Sehome Hill before Western Washington University even exists. She writes about Sehome Hill when
                        Settler Colonialists are setting the trees on fire on Sehome Hill at night, and burning all the
                        trees down so that they could clear more land.</p> <p>We know in the twenty-first century that these things happened on Sehome Hill. But it is only
                        through Ella Higginson’s writing that we can actually see the history of Sehome Hill, stage by
                        stage, and watch as it becomes a different part of a different community as time goes on.</p> <h3>Click to listen to the poems that Ella Higginson was inspired by Sehome Hill</h3> <wwu-switcher label="Accessible Label"> <wwu-switcher-item label="A White Night"> <h4>Introduction to "A White Night"</h4> <audio controls> <source src="higginsonaudio/a_white_night_intro.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio> <h4>Transcript:</h4> <p>Laura Laffrado:</p> <p>This is Laura Laffrado.

                                night she was walking on Sehome Hill and she was so enjoying the smells and the sounds
                                and the beauty of Sehome Hill at night. And she knew that when she looked out her window
                                out at Puget Sound, she could see the beauty of Puget Sound. And she thought that this
                                was all so overwhelmingly gorgeous that not even the dead could sleep through an
                                experience like this. And this is the poem that she wrote.</p> <h4>"A White Night"</h4> <audio controls> <source src="higginsonaudio/a_white_night_reading.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio> <h4>Transcript:</h4> <p>Laura Laffrado:</p> <p>This is Laura Laffrado, Professor of English at Western Washington University.

                                Ella Higginson.</p> <p>Ella Higginson traveled by train with her husband across the entire United States from
                                the Pacific Northwest to the Northeastern United States so that Ella could meet the
                                extended family of her very distinguished husband.</p> <p>While they were on this trip, they visited New York City, and went to see Brooklyn
                                Bridge, a very notable landmark. And at Brooklyn Bridge, Ella became overwhelmed with
                                the heat and the noise, and the energy of the larger city, so different from the then
                                remote, small town that she lived in the Pacific Northwest. She became homesick thinking
                                about the moon rising over Sehome Hill and she wrote this poem.</p> <h4>"Midnight on Brooklyn Bridge</h4> <audio controls> <source src="higginsonaudio/midnight_on_brooklyn_bridge_reading.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio> <h4>Transcript:</h4> <p>Laura Laffrado:</p> <p>This is Laura Laffrado, Professor of English at Western Washington University.

                                she was gone. How she would look at her window at night watching the moon rising over
                                Sehome Hill and be terribly lonely. And this was the poem she wrote about that

                                several very close family members. Her father, her mother, and then her husband had died
                                and she was sunk into grief. During the spring she was walking on Sehome Hill, watching
                                everything start to come to life again. And she prayed to God that she too, could be
                                reborn like the nature around her on Sehome Hill. And this is the poem that she wrote
                                about that experience.</p> <h4>"The Awakening"</h4> <audio controls> <source src="higginsonaudio/the_awakening_reading.mp3" type="audio/wav"> </audio> <h4>Transcript:</h4> <p>Laura Laffrado:</p> <p>This is Laura Laffrado, Professor of English at Western Washington University.
