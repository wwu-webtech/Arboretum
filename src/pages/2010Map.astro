                    <p>
                        Nestled between two portions of Huntoon Trail, just below the watch tower at the top of the hill is the Quiet
                        Rocks area. Whether it's just for a moment, or for an entire afternoon, this is a great location to sit and enjoy the sounds of the nature surrounding you, under a canopy of deciduous trees.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3 id="watchtower">Watch Tower</h3>
                    <p>
                        Standing tall atop Sehome Hill is the Watch Tower. Visitors can climb to the top and take in the view of the greater Bellingham area and bay as well as enjoying the sounds of nature. Almost any trail will connect you to a passage to the tower. It's a must see.

                    <h3 id="landslide">The Old Quarry, Geologic Outcrop and Landslide</h3>
                    <p>
                        There was once a quarry on the hill. A short walk beyond the watchtower, you can find a geologic out crop showing the stratification of
                            the sedimentary rock underlying the layers of topsoil and vegetation. If you'd like to learn more about the out crop, visit the <a href="geology.html">Geology</a> page of this website.
