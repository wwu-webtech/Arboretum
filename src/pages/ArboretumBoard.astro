			<h1>Sehome Hill Board of Governors (SHABOG)</h1>
	  
			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>
			  <a href="https://cob.org/gov/public/bc/arboretum">The SHABOG</a> was
			  created under the Inter-Local Cooperation
			  Agreement between the
			  City of Bellingham (City) and Western Washington University (WWU). The purpose of the Board is to develop and
			  coordinate the Sehome Hill Arboretum program. The Board works with the City and WWU in planning the use of such
			  capital, operating and maintenance funds as shall be authorized by the City of Bellingham or WWU, and such
			  endowment funds to the Arboretum as may be received by either agency. The Board of Governors coordinates with
			  WWU
			  and City Parks and Recreation maintenance and operations programs. These are all volunteer projects associated
			  with the Arboretum. The Board establishes and submits priorities for maintenance and development of the
			  Arboretum
			  in accordance with the Long Range Master Plan adopted by the City and Western Washington University. Finally, the
			  Board may make recommendations to the City Council and Board of Trustees of WWU concerning the continuation,
			  modification, or termination of the Inter-Local agreement.

<h3>Community Cooperation</h3>

			The   Inter-Local agreement is currently valid until July 2034.
