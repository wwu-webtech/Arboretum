			<h1>Welcome to Western's Sehome Hill Arboretum Website (WSHAW)!</h1>
      <h2>About the WSHAW</h2>

      <p>
        Not far from the shores of Bellingham Bay and rising above the old town of Bellingham Washington lies a lush
        green forest. The 175.5 acres of the Sehome Hill Arboretum are dedicated to a Pacific Northwest
        natural environment.

        It is a preserve, a park, a home, and a
        respite from the bustle of university and city life.
      </p>

      <h2>On the WSHAW , You’ll Find Information About:</h2>
      <p>

        <li>The life sustained by the hill</li>

      <p>
        After decades of conservation, the Arboretum is mixed terrain and is here for a nice stroll, a great hike, or
        simply escaping for the day. The Arboretum will exist for decades to come, and has existed in its current
        state for well over a century. We hope to encourage ecological restoration of the 175.5 acre area as a "New Old Growth
        Forest" where nature will define your paths to cross and experience all that the Arboretum has to offer for you.
      </p>
